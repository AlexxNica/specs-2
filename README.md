# Beaker Browser Specs Repo

Repo of specifications, documents, and related discussions.

## Directorories

### Proposals ([link](./proposals))

Proposals are numbered. They are informally structured, but we may add a structure over time. Sometimes, proposals are really just plans by the Beaker core team, which we wanted to explain to the community. Proposals may also come from people outside of the core team, and can cover any aspect of the browser or its technologies.

## How to:

### Add a proposal

Make a PR with the new proposal. Proposals are accepted if we think they have enough merit to be considered broadly. If you want to suggest an idea prior to writing a proposal, you can make an issue.

### Discuss a proposal

Open an issue or PR.
